        I got admission in Engineering college in which i wanted to take admission.<br/><br/>
        The next chapter of my life began, initially there was fear that how would i will be surviving in this hell.<br/>
        But as the time passed, the fear was turned into joy.<br/>
        After making the bunch of friends and settling in the course there was time for first semester exams.<br/>
        First time i was feeling tentative as it was our first semester exams we were having no idea about engineering exams.<br/>
        The semester ended and again we were back on track, On track of having fun , enjoying college days & we were again busy on making memories.
        and thats how the rest of semester got spended wih full of fun.

        <li><a name="job" class="title">Starting my First Job</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most of us look at our very first job as a memorable milestone in our young lives. It was when we first experienced some independence by earning our own money, entrusted with the adult responsibility of employment and held accountable not only to our parents or teachers but to a boss and company.
         ​<br/>
        One of my first jobs was working for the City of Boston Parks and Recreational Services Dept.  It was a job that I obtained through connections my family had and I was not old enough to do it according to the rules (that were bent).  Most of the staff were at least 18 years old. I was only 15 and it was to be my summer job that year of high school.
        <br/>
         It was a physical job and I was short and not very strong.  The exercise of mowing lawns and maintaining the grounds of one of Boston’s most beautiful and largest parks (Boston Common) was probably very needed and better for me than I would ever have admitted back then.
        <br/><br/>
        Truth be told, I hated every minute of the job for the first month or so.  It was being out in the hot summer sun all day and assigned everything from cleaning outside porta- potties, shoveling droppings from the park ranger horses, to riding on a garbage truck and emptying large park trash receptacles that I was only a foot taller than which was a struggle to lift over my head and dump. Most of the contents fell on me rather than into the truck, which made for an embarrassing train ride home as one can imagine what I smelled like.  The job was clearly not my cup of tea, not because I felt it was beneath me in any way, but because I just wasn’t very good at it.  I mis- operated and damaged every piece of maintenance equipment I used from leaf blowers, weed whackers, and lawn mowers to taking five times longer than the others when assigned to garbage removal, fence painting, and tree trimming. I wasn’t lazy, just very uncoordinated and very misplaced as I was smaller and younger than everyone else.
        <br/>
        What I know now is that in that job I hated so much I was also learning and growing, and by the end of that summer things changed for me. I was mentored by the foreman who was a great person and could see I was feeling like a fish out of water. He was patient with me, kept me busy, and covered for me when I messed up.  I learned a lot from that gentleman about sticking with things that I wasn’t very good at and not quitting.  I didn’t realize it then, but he was mentoring me and teaching me things that I never would have had the opportunity to attempt.  I also learned about asking for help as well as studying others to learn and do my job better (a valuable lesson I took with me to every future form of employment I obtained).
        <br/><br/>
        I started to become friendly with those older, bigger co-workers that I was so intimidated by.  They took me under their wing and I knew I had people looking out for me should I ever need them.  I was never as good at the job as they were, but it didn’t mean I couldn’t become their peer and I realized the 100% that I was giving was very valuable.  What they did better, I could work at and eventually learn to be as good at. Again, the job I loathed was teaching me about setting goals and working to achieve them.
        <br/>
        The whole experience made me realize that despite the fresh air and being outdoors, I was not cut out for that type of work after high school (and hats off to those that choose it). It’s physically demanding on you and New England weather isn’t the place to always be outdoors.  I earned a new respect for people with physical professions who tested their strength and endurance every day. I had a decision to make. Did I see myself going to trade school and possibly making a great living? Or could I work harder academically and pursue college to give myself more options professionally?  It was a turning point where I could have decided to take nothing away from that job and perhaps return there each summer or to work that was similar. One thing I knew was that working was going to be just as necessary as breathing for most of my life. I ultimately chose something different than being outdoors, but I realized it wouldn’t be given to me, as the job I was not very good at  had been. I was lucky to have the opportunity to choose something that would make me happier than doing something I was already qualified (well, sort of) to do.
        <br/>
         Fast forward 3 decades later. Many, many other jobs (some that I loved and some that I haven’t) were all experiences I not only worked in but was present in the knowledge that I had to take something away from each job.  You can learn from any job and develop lasting relationships that can go beyond that company or department. Like it or not, for most of us, what we do for work does become a part of who we are.  If you are a recent grad that took a job that is not ideal, but you needed a job, make the best of it and take the best from it. There are valuable lessons and gains from everything we go through in life if we just take time to look for them. Time can change many situations. Give everything a fair chance and one day you can look at the hardest and most arduous of experiences as great ones, just like I now do at that summer I turned 15 and never sweated so much or smelled so badly riding the T home.  I didn’t enjoy it much most of the time, but in many ways, it was the best job that I ever had.

    </ul>
    <p>
        Honestly, I don’t know what it was that made me fall in love with my Honda Civic – but I was obsessed with the idea of getting one from the moment I first saw one! I would search online and save pictures of them, whilst figuring out how much it would cost monthly on finance to bag myself one. I did plenty of research on different car supermarkets almost daily, to see what was available and how quickly they were going.

        Honestly, I don’t know what it was that made me fall in love with my Honda Civic – but I was obsessed with the idea of getting one from the moment I first saw one! I would search online and save pictures of them, whilst figuring out how much it would cost monthly on finance to bag myself one. I did plenty of research on different car supermarkets almost daily, to see what was available and how quickly they were going.
        <br/><br/>
        Every day I would find myself watching videos online about the 500 to check the specifications of the car – like I didn’t already know! I decided to go and look at the Fiats myself, so went down to my local car supermarket and grilled the saleswoman as much as I could. Whilst it was second-hand, they had a Honda Civic in stock so I asked as much as I could about it. What is the drive like? Any MOT issues? How economic is it? I was probably a bit full on, but I needed to know exactly what I would be buying.
        <br/>
        After doing as many checks as I could, everything came back clear so I took the plunge. I knew it was the one for me! I put a deposit down of £1000, and the dealership agreed I could pay off the rest in chunks – which saved me from a finance option as I really wanted to own my car straight away. In total, I felt my car was a good deal – they even agreed to drop it off at my house!
        <br/><br/>
        I decided not to tell anyone that I’d bought my first car. I wanted it to be a surprise so everyone could see my car when it has actually arrived. I knew I had checked everything that I needed to, so I was happy with my purchase. However, I soon caved and told my close friends – I couldn’t keep it in any longer! But I kept the surprise from my parents. They had gone away for a few days, so I arranged for the car to be delivered within that time, so when they got back they would see my Fiat in all its glory. Everyone I know loves the Honda Civic! Their unique shape and colour options seem to almost make every single one different, and I was so excited to see what everyone thought because I finally had one of my own.
        <br/>
        When my parents arrived home from their trip, they could see my little Honda Civic on the driveway! I went in for the shock factor and definitely got it. They did ask me lots of questions because they were concerned I’d made a bad decision but once I explained I had done all of the research, they got on board. Honestly, I was more worried that they would be mad at me, but after they had checked the car out – they could see I’d made a great decision! Now, I have to hide my car keys because my Mum is desperate to drive it!

    </ul>
    <p>
        
        As you can read in my last blog post, I have just recently finished renovating my laundry room. I am super happy with the result, but as with any renovation project, it is a process that always takes longer, costs more and is exhausting while it is going on.
        <br/>
        So one evening while I renovated I needed a timeout. And what better way to unwind than to go to Pinterest, right? Here, among all the things I have pinned over the years I found a board that I had not looked at for a while. My inspirational board for my dream house.
        <br/><br/>
        Yes, like I guess many of you I have for years had this dream of building my own house. Don´t get me wrong, I love the house we live in now, but there’s something about the process of building my own house. Getting it just the way I want it. With all the great new designs and innovations that are possible when building a new house today.
        <br/>
        With an old house it seems like the list is never ending with renovation projects, and (hopefully) with a new house I would get a fresh start rather than continuously having to set aside money for the next thing that needs to be fixed.
        <br/><br/>
        But most importantly, I like being the creator. To see a massive structure coming together from what started as ideas in my imagination. And since I enjoyed so much looking at what I had pinned, I thought I would share some of the ideas with you. Maybe you also have this dream and have some ideas to share with me?
        <br/>
        As you can see most of the photos I have pinned are from inside the house. The reason for this is that I feel it is important to get a sense of how the rooms should be like before I decide on the architecture of the house. In my view, the floor plan will sort of set the standard for how the house will be.
        <br/>
        and Thats how i completed my DREAM HOUSE PROJECT..!!
